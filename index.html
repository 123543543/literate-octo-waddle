    <p>All great men have been taught to read and write at their schools. It is our school that endows us with the right values at an early age. We teach a set of strong moral values that serve us later in our lives. School life is the period that makes up most of your childhood memories. We learn to laugh, cry, share, and support by co-habiting with our classmates. Schools are the framework that builds our moral characters and serves as a pathway that we must follow to achieve our dreams.

      The initial years pass like a breeze and are the best years of our school life but, the advanced grades teach us that life is not always easy. We fail in tests, we stay awake at nights to finish assignments, we get scolded by teachers, but most importantly, we learn how to cope up with the hardships that life throws at us. Schools have a tremendous responsibility in shaping the minds of millions of young minds that are as soft as wet mud. The teachers are excellent potters who mold us so that the resultant figure is ready to bear the weight of life without cracking. Even if the later stages of school life feel like a burden, we must remember that our school’s happiest times have been spent.
